This is an event manager website.
There are pages:

**CSE homepage is linked for some quick look-up of any information by the user.
Home page contains two frequently used operations; login for booking and cancelling and major events' announcements.
Resources page contain available venues with department along with required information about them which will be dynamically displayed There is a simple SignUp page to be a member(only if you are authorised to be)
Current Status shows the calendar with events' time and place to check availability at time of booking or for general referance.
This is just the basic look up of the website .Functionality will soon be embedded.
Its been very tiring but awesome feeling to build this especially starting from zero knowledge.Hope you like it.
