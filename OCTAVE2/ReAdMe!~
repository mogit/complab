Steps to follow:
*delete all files named y*.txt or s**.txt from current directory
*open terminal
*cd to directory containing script files
*open R
*give following two commands to R
source("r_1.R")
source("r_2.R") 
* This will create 3+12 files
* Now open gnuplot with arguement r_1.gnu for seeing 3 distributions on density/OR
with arguement r_2.gnu for seeing random values' rowstacked histogram
OR
with arguement r_2r.gnu for seeing normal histogram
OR
with arguement r_2rr.gnu to see rowstacked histogram and initial graph of y1/y2/y3 on same window
***For work of octave go to "oct" folder

*delete all files starting with y or s
*open terminal
*cd to this directory("oct")
*open octave with arguement oct_1.m once
then again with arguement oct_2.m .
*this will create 3+12 files.
*Gnuplot procedure is then same except files are noe oct_1.gnu, oct_2.gnu and oct_2r.gnu
NOTE:
1)running r_2.R will take some time.
